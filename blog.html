    <h2>1. What are the defenses of filter, map, forEach, find in Angular?</h2>
    <h4 class="text-color">Answer :</h4>
    <p>
        Filter: A filter function is used to iterate through an array or collection of items and return a new array or
        collection with only the items that meet a certain condition. The condition is specified in the form of a
        callback function that returns a Boolean value.
        <br><br>
        Map: A map function is used to iterate through an array or collection of items and return a new array or
        collection with the same number of items but with each item transformed by a callback function. The
        transformation function takes each item as input and returns a modified version of it.
        <br><br>
        ForEach: A forEach function is used to iterate through an array or collection of items and perform a callback
        function on each item. The callback function can be used to modify the items or perform some action based on the
        item.
        <br><br>
        Find: A find function is used to search an array or collection of items and return the first item that meets a
        certain condition. The condition is specified in the form of a callback function that returns a Boolean value.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What are the differences between localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies?</h2>
    <h4 class="text-color">Answer :</h4>  
    <p>localStorage: It is a web storage API that allows web applications to store key/value pairs in a web browser. The
        data stored in localStorage persists even after the browser is closed and can be accessed by any JavaScript
        running in the same origin. The data can be accessed and modified by the web application itself or by other
        JavaScript running in the same origin.
        <br><br>
        sessionStorage: It is similar to localStorage, but the data stored in sessionStorage is only accessible within
        the same session. The data is lost when the browser window is closed, and it cannot be accessed by other browser
        tabs or windows.
        <br><br>
        Cookies: Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's computer by a web browser. They are typically
        used to store user preferences or login information. Cookies can be set with an expiration date or can be
        session cookies that are deleted when the user closes the browser. Cookies can be accessed and modified by both
        the web application and the server.

    <h2>3. How does the event loop work?</h2>
    <h4 class="text-color">Answer :</h4>
    <p>The Event Loop is a core component of the JavaScript runtime that manages the execution of asynchronous
        operations in JavaScript. It operates by continuously monitoring the execution stack and the event queue, and
        processes events one at a time in a loop.

        When an asynchronous operation is initiated, it is added to the event queue, along with a callback function that
        should be executed once the operation is completed. The event loop continuously checks the event queue for any
        pending events.

        When an event is detected in the queue, the event loop retrieves the associated callback function and adds it to
        the execution stack. The callback function is then executed and any returned values are returned to the caller.

        The event loop continues this process of checking for events, retrieving the associated callback function, and
        executing it until there are no more events in the queue.

        The event loop allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations efficiently and without blocking the main
        execution thread. This enables developers to write applications that are more responsive and performant.

    <h2>4.1 What is the function of quizTimer?</h2>
    <h4 class="text-color">Answer :</h4>
    <p>
        The quizTimer function appears to be a JavaScript function that takes in a single argument dismiss. It seems to
        be responsible for setting up and controlling a timer that updates an HTML element with an id of count every
        second.

        If dismiss is truthy (e.g. true, a non-zero number, or a non-empty string), the function will clear the timer
        using the clearInterval function and return immediately.

        Otherwise, the function will repeatedly execute an anonymous arrow function every 1000 milliseconds (i.e. every
        second) using the setInterval function. This arrow function first retrieves the HTML element with id count using
        the querySelector method, and then formats the current count (which starts at 0 and increments by 1 every
        second) into minutes and seconds.

        The formatted minutes and seconds are then used to update the HTML content of the count element. Additionally,
        if the count exceeds 60 seconds, the function alternates between adding and removing CSS classes (text-red-300
        and text-red-700) from the count element, presumably to add a visual effect.

        Overall, it appears that this function is designed to be used in the context of a quiz or similar timed activity
        where a countdown timer needs to be displayed and managed.

    <h2>4.2 What is the function of chooseQuiz?</h2>
    <h4 class="text-color">Answer :</h4>
    <p>
        This is a JavaScript function called chooseQuiz that takes two arguments: index and givenAns. It appears to be a
        part of a larger program that manages a quiz or survey, where quizData contains the questions and answers
        contains the user's responses.

        The function first checks if there is already an answer object in the answers array that corresponds to the
        question at the given index. If such an object exists, the function updates it with the user's givenAns. If not,
        it creates a new answer object with the current question and the user's givenAns and adds it to the answers
        array.

        After the answers array has been updated, the function calls a displayAnswers function to update the UI with the
        new answers.

        It's worth noting that this function assumes that answers and quizData have the same length and that the objects
        in answers have an id property that matches the corresponding question in quizData. If these assumptions are not
        met, the function could potentially throw errors.
